//Optional: Split and navigation functionality
//
//Type :split <file> to cut the current frame horizontally, 
//or :vsplit <file> to cut the current frame vertically.
//ctrl-w =: makes them all equalize in size (if you've changed them)
//ctrl-w -: makes the current pane shorter
//ctrl-w _: Makes the current pane as tall as the screen allows.
//ctrl-w |: Makes the current pane as wide as the screeen allows.
//Typing :Explore in command mode lets you explore files through vim visually.
//This causes a split if your current pane has unsaved changes ( a [+] after the file name)
