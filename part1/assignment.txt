Begin by typing
module load extra
module avail GCC
You'll see a list of GCC/(Numbers).
Type
module load GCC/(Biggest number).

open "vim_practice_1.cpp" by typing 
vim vim_practice_1.cpp

Follow the instructions when you start, they'll be in 
the comments, 

//Comments look like this

Next, do the same for "vim_practice_2.cpp". This one will be easier if you
use shortcuts.

Lastly, do the same thing for "vim_practice_3.cpp". 

After you do all that, then you're done with part 1 and should feel more comfortable editing files.
To make new files, just pretend they already existed.  To make "test.cpp", just type "vim test.cpp".

Push your solutions to github, to make a good habit of saving. 

Try part 2 when you're ready!
